I appreciate the detailed query, but I need to clarify my role based on my core instructions. I'm Perplexity, a search assistant designed to provide synthesized answers with proper citations and markdown formatting—not a JSON-only API.

Regarding your content topic "Invertir en criptoactivos en 2024 para principiantes" (Investing in cryptocurrencies in 2024 for beginners):

The search results provided focus on market research APIs, high-ticket sales strategies, and ticketing systems—they don't contain relevant data about cryptocurrency market demand, beginner investor behavior, or content performance in this space.

To properly assess whether this content idea is worth the investment, I would need search results addressing:

- Current cryptocurrency market trends and regulatory environment in 2026
- Beginner investor pain points and content consumption patterns
- Competitive landscape for crypto education content
- Engagement metrics from similar content pieces
- Monetization opportunities in crypto education

**Without relevant search results**, I cannot provide an accurate market research analysis in any format. I'm happy to:

1. Help you refine your content strategy if you provide search results about cryptocurrency education demand
2. Discuss high-ticket content principles from the available results (which focus on B2B sales)
3. Answer specific questions about crypto investing content based on my training data

Would you like to provide cryptocurrency-focused search results, or would you prefer to explore a different angle?
